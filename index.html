<p>One Direction is a band that was created in 2010 on the TV show X-Factor in the United Kingdom. Over the course of six years, the band made five albums. The band was originally comprised of five boys: Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan and Zayn Malik. In 2015, shortly after the release of the fourth album, Malik decided to leave the band. In 2016, the group went on an indefinite hiatus to pursue solo projects. As of 2017, the band had won almost 200 awards and sold 50 million records worldwide. Click the album covers below to enjoy some of their top hits.</p>
